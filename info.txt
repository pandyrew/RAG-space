RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Model Information

Quick Summary:
Key Technologies: Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Llama 2 (via Ollama), FAISS, SentenceTransformers
Architecture: RAG model combining retrieval (FAISS) and generation (Llama 2)
Deployment: Local development with Uvicorn

1. Model Overview:
   - This project implements a RAG model, combining retrieval-based and generative AI approaches.
   - RAG enhances language model outputs by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.

2. Key Components:
   - Language Model: Llama 2 (via Ollama)
   - Retriever: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
   - Knowledge Base: Local text file (fakefacts.txt)

3. Infrastructure:
   - Backend: Python with FastAPI
   - Vector Database: FAISS for efficient similarity search
   - API Layer: RESTful API with FastAPI
   - Deployment: Local development server (Uvicorn)

4. Key Technologies:
   - LangChain: Orchestrates the RAG pipeline, manages prompts, and interfaces with the language model
   - SentenceTransformers: Generates embeddings for document retrieval
   - Ollama: Provides access to the Llama 2 language model
   - Pydantic: Handles data validation for API requests
   - NumPy: Supports numerical operations for vector manipulations

5. Key Features:
   - Real-time information retrieval using FAISS
   - Dynamic knowledge base updates
   - Customizable prompt template for query processing
   - Logging for debugging and monitoring

6. API Endpoint:
   - POST /generate: Accepts a query and returns a generated response with retrieved documents

7. Performance Considerations:
   - FAISS enables fast similarity search for large document collections
   - SentenceTransformers provides efficient document encoding
   - Asynchronous API handling with FastAPI for improved concurrency

8. Future Improvements:
   - Implement fine-tuning pipeline for domain-specific adaptation
   - Enhance retriever with multi-modal capabilities
   - Integrate user feedback loop for continuous improvement
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed documents or queries

9. Development and Deployment:
   - Local development using Uvicorn server
   - Potential for containerization with Docker for easier deployment
   - Scalability can be improved by distributing FAISS index across multiple nodes

This RAG implementation leverages modern NLP technologies and efficient retrieval systems to provide a powerful question-answering capability based on a custom knowledge base.
